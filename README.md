# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Our client, Louise, is attempting raise money for her play, *Fever*, through a kickstarter campaign. We were approached to conduct an analysis of previous kickstarter campaigns to evaluate the likelihood of her reaching her fundraising goals, and to determine factors that may influence success of her fundraising campaign. 

### Purpose
Analyze previous kickstarter data to determine if there is a correlation with kickstarter success and campaign launch date or the goal fundraising amount.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. When it comes to kickstarter campaings to raise money for theater isues, May appears to be the most successful month to launch a campaign, with the most successful campaigns (111), with only 52 failed campaigns.

2. December appears to be the worst month to launch a campaign to support theater issues, with nearly as many failed (35) campaigns as successful (37) campaigns.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. For campaign goals <$35,000, there appears to be a negative correlation between goal amount and the success rate of a given campaign. For campaigns seeking <$15,000, odds of success were greater than odds of failure. For campaigns seeking ≥$20,000, odds of failure were greater than odds of success. For campaigns seeking between $15,000 and $20,000, odds of success were 50%. For campaigns seeking ≥$35,000, there was no clear pattern of success vs failure.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?

1. The largest limitation with the dataset is that it doesn't take into account a couple of major factors, which are difficult to apply a value to:

    a. The quality of the product the kickstarter campaign is supporting.

    b. How well the kickstarter campaign was publicized.  

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1. A graph showing the success rate of campaigns (i.e. successful campaigns/total campaigns launched) would be very useful. From the currently provided graphs, it is hard to tell whether May had the most successful campaigns due to a higher success rate, or only due to more campaigns being launched.

2. A graph showing the success vs. failure of campaigns based on campaign duration. From the currently provided graphs, it isn't clear whether or not campaign duration plays a factor in campaign success.
