# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Our client, Louise, is attempting raise money for her play, *Fever*, through a kickstarter campaign. We were approached to conduct an analysis of previous kickstarter campaigns to evaluate the likelihood of her reaching her fundraising goals, and to determine factors that may influence success of her fundraising campaign. 

### Purpose
Analyze previous kickstarter data to determine if there is a correlation with kickstarter success and campaign launch date or the goal fundraising amount.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. When it comes to kickstarter campaings to raise money for theater isues, May appears to be the most successful month to launch a campaign, with the most successful campaings (111) and the highest success rate (67%)

2. December appears to be the worst month to launch a campaign to support theater issues, with nearly as many failed (35) campaigns as successful (37) campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. There is a linear trend... *need to flush out*

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
